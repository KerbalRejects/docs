    * Bring up to the individual that they are taking over the project and escalate if necessary.

3. How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

### Git Process

* All components of the codebase and documentation will live on Github.

* We will share the repository through a organization page on GitHub.

**Git Flow**

* Main, dev and feature branches.

feature -> dev -> main

* Two people to review the PR (to main) to ensure that it won't break the entire project.

* Anyone can merge PRs.

* Merge as needed into dev. Merge once for final push into main. Before practice of final presentation.

* We will communicate verbally.
