# KerbalRejects Pitches

## Pitch 1:

### Space Explorer Application

Summary:
* A web application utilizing NASA's API to track the night sky and see what is in view of a given location. It will take into account weather data (weatherBit API) for the given location and provide information and facts about what the user is looking at.

* This app allows the user to lookup what they can see in the night sky before going out. Anything from where the International Space Station (ISS) is currently located to the planets and visible stars/galaxies.

* Our project MVP is: A form to collect the users location and what the user wants to see. Query both WeatherBIT and NASA API with information and return the user the collection of objects in the sky at that current time of day. Save and remove previous search queries and timestamps. Add favorites to searches/days allow uploading of photos taken by the user, tie user uploads and queries to their profile.

## Pitch 2:

### Trail Explorer Application

Summary:
* A web application utilizing TrailAPI to give the user a list of all trails in the location that the input. It will take into account weather data (WeatherBIT API) for the week.

* This app allows users to get trail information from anywhere in the world in order to plan their next hike. It will also provide the user with weather information for the week to plan the hike accordingly.

* Our project MVP is: Allowing the user to fill out a form with a location and desired trail type, length and difficulty. Give the user a map of the area with the trails. Store the search query in the user profile and allow them to create hiking plans and trip plans. Add favorite searches.
